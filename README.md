## Question 1

* I have assumed user input i.e. Emp id of two employee will be given as space seperated.

## Question 2

* I have considered input will be given one line by another without using `Date1:` , simply `10th September, 2020` and next line `11th September, 2020`. And the input Date2 will be `greater or equal to` input Date1.

* Output will be simply date difference i.e. without `Date Difference:`, only 1 Day.

* Considered date input format is `DD/MM/YYYY` , `DD.MM.YYYY` , `DD-MM-YYYY` , `1st Oct, 2020` , `13th october, 2020`.

## Question 3

* I have assumed date in both the text files will be same. And user input will be given as float format like .5 , 1.5 , 6.
