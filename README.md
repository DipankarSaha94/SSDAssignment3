## Question 1

* The function `answer` is divided into 5 different functions as `answer`,`getplist`,`findleader1`,`findleader2`,`findleader3` and used lambda function instead of multiple if else loop to achieve the complexity A.

## Question 2

* I have reduced the multiple if else loop by help of a list check in `changeformat` function. And divide the function `getDifference` into 2 function `getDifference`,`noofdays` to do the repetitive task to achieve the ideal complexity A.

## Question 3

* have deleted the repetitive part in `addtime` function by reducing the argument passed into it, to get the final complexity A.
